# FingerMouseController
This is an experimental Project, The main aim of it is to control the mouse pointer using your finger.

The Program will first Require your hand's skin color. Then based on it will make a Color Histogram for differentiation b/w env / your finger. I have used the Histogram Technique to detect skin tone for proper detection in harsh color env.
