# FingerMouseController
This is a experimental Project , The main aim of it is to control the mouse pointer using your finger.

The Program will first Require you hands skin color . Then on the basis of it will make a Color Histogram for differentiation b/w env / your finger.
I have used Histogram Technique to detect skin tone for proper detection in harsh color env.
